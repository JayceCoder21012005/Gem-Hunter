This is a project using CNFs.

* To execute this program, you will see these line of codes in console:
- Usage: python main.py <algorithm> <test_case>
- algorithm: pysat, backtracking, bruteforce
- test_case: 5x5, 11x11, 20x20
* For example: If you want to test "Bruteforce Algorithm" with testcase: 5x5. You type:
``` python src/main.py bruteforce 5x5 ```
* You can check all algorithm with all testcases by running ```table.py```. This will export a .pdf file that contains all the experimental result.
* Thanks for your reading.
